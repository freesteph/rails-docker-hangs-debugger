* Ruby + Docker template

[[https://github.com/freesteph/ruby-docker-template/raw/main/logo.png]]

This starter kit provides a containerized Ruby environment to get
hacking quickly without being a dirty dog.

The Dockerfile is configured to run ~bundle exec ruby main.rb~.

** Getting started

1. Clone this repo with a different name (or use the GitHub "Use this
   template" feature):

  #+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/freesteph/ruby-docker-template.git your-fancy-hack
  #+end_src

2. Hack away

  #+begin_src sh
  emacs main.rb
  #+end_src

3. Run things in an environement that will work for *other* people:

   #+begin_src sh
   make up
   #+end_src

See the [[file:Makefile][Makefile]] for other ways to interact with your project.
